This Java program demonstrates thread creation and use of its various methods.

ThreadExample.java

This file contains the ThreadExample class which has the main method. This method creates two threads and starts them. The run method of each thread is executed, which prints out a message to the console. The Thread.sleep() method is used to pause the execution of each thread for a certain amount of time. The join() method is used to wait for the threads to complete before continuing with the main thread.

ThreadDemo1.java

This file contains the ThreadDemo1 class which extends the Thread class. This class overrides the run() method to define the behavior of the thread when it is started. The Thread.sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the thread for a certain amount of time.

ThreadDemo2.java

This file contains the ThreadDemo2 class which implements the Runnable interface. This class implements the run() method to define the behavior of the thread when it is started. The Thread.sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the thread for a certain amount of time.

ThreadDemo3.java

This file contains the ThreadDemo3 class which extends the Thread class. This class overrides the run() method to define the behavior of the thread when it is started. The Thread.sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the thread for a certain amount of time. Additionally, this class has a constructor that takes a string argument which is used to set the name of the thread.

ThreadDemo4.java

This file contains the ThreadDemo4 class which implements the Runnable interface. This class implements the run() method to define the behavior of the thread when it is started. The Thread.sleep() method is used to pause the execution of the thread for a certain amount of time.
